## Aggregate Stats

The **Aggregate stats** panel displays a real-time summary of the resources used by the workflow. These include total running time ('wall time'), aggregated CPU time (CPU hours), memory usage (GB hours), data i/o and cost.

The cost is only based on estimated computation usage and does not currently take into account storage or associated network costs. Tower has a database of costs for all cloud instances of AWS and Google Cloud in all regions and zones.


## Load and Utilization

As processes are being submitted to the compute environment, the **Load** monitors how many cores and tasks are currently being used. For the cores gauge chart, the denominator is the maximum number of cores that have already been used at that moment during the execution of that specific pipeline.

**Utilization** is calculated for memory and CPUs. This is the average value across all tasks and is calculated by dividing the memory (or CPUs) usage by the memory (or CPUs) requested.
