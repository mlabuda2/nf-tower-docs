## Introduction

Tower uses the concept of **Credentials** to store the keys and tokens necessary to access the [Compute Environments](../compute-envs/overview.md) as well as [Git hosting services](../git/overview.md). The instructions for adding the credentials are mentioned in the documentation for respective compute environment or git hosting section of this documentation.
