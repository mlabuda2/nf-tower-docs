## Email Notifications

You can receive email notifications at the completion or a failure of a workflow execution.

Navigate to your [profile page](https://tower.nf/profile) using dropdown on your avatar (top-right) and then select the **Send notification email on workflow completion** toggle option at the bottom of the profile settings page.
