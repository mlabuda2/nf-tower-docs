!!! note 
    This feature is available from Tower v.22.3.

## Overview

From version 22.3, Tower contains a **Dashboard** page that provides an overview of runs in your organizations and personal workspace at a glance. The dashboard is accessed from the user menu in the top right corner. Click your avatar, then select "Dashboard".

The page is split into two main areas:

## Filters and summary

The drop-down lists at the top of the dashboard page filter total runs by your personal workspace, the organizations you have access to, and time range.

Below the filters, a summary of total runs is shown by status.

## Runs per organization

Below the cards displaying total runs by status, run totals are filtered by each organization or your personal workspace. Filtering depends on what you selected in the drop-down options near the top of the page. 

Each card represents an organization. Total runs for the organization are arranged by workspace and status.

There are various navigation options you can go from here if you want to investigate further on your workflows.

 - On the one hand, you can click on every workspace name to see the workflow runs in the context of that workspace.
 - On the other hand, you can click on any count number in any cell to see the workflow runs in the context of that workspace that are in that specific status (the filters there will be set for you automatically).
