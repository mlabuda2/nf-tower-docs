## Overview

!!! note 
    This feature is available from Tower v.22.3.

From version 22.3, Tower contains a **Dashboard** page that provides an overview of runs in your organizations and personal workspace at a glance. The dashboard is accessed from the user menu in the top right corner. Click your avatar, then select "Dashboard".

The page is split into two main areas:

### Filters and summary

The Dashboard view defaults to all organizations and workspaces you can access. Select the drop-down next to **View:** to filter by specific organizations and workspaces, or to view statistics for your personal workspace only.

The filter button provides options for filtering by time, including a custom date range of up to 12 months. The button icon and color changes to indicate when a filter has been applied to your dashboard view. 

Below the filters, a summary of total runs is shown by status.

### Runs per organization

Below the cards displaying total runs by status, run totals are filtered by each organization or your personal workspace. Filtering depends on what you selected in the drop-down options near the top of the page.

Each card represents an organization. Total runs for the organization are arranged by workspace and status.
