## Overview

[Altair PBS Pro](https://www.altair.com/pbs-professional/) is a workload manager and job scheduler tool provided by [Altair Engineering, Inc](https://www.altair.com).

## Requirements

To launch pipelines into a **Altair PBS Pro** scheduler from Tower, the following requirements must be fulfilled:

- The cluster should be reachable via an SSH connection using an SSH key.
- The cluster should allow outbound connections to the Tower web service.
- The cluster queue used to run the Nextflow head job must be able to submit cluster jobs.
- The Nextflow runtime version **21.02.0-edge** (or later) should be installed on the cluster.

## Compute environment

Follow these steps to create a new compute environment for **Altair PBS Pro**:

**1.** In a workspace choose "Compute environments" and then, click on the **New Environment** button.

**2.** Enter a descriptive name (e.g. _PBS Pro On-prem_) and select **Altair PBS Pro** as the target platform.

**3.** Select the **+** sign to add new SSH credentials.

**4.** Enter a name for the credentials.

**5.** Enter your **SSH private key** and associated **Passphrase**, if required then click **Create**.

!!! tip
    A passphrase for your SSH key may be optional depending on how it was created. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) for detailed instructions for how to create a key.


**6.** Enter the absolute path of the **Work directory** to be used on the cluster.

**7.** Enter the absolute path of the **Launch directory** to be used on the cluster (optional).

**8.** Enter the **Login hostname**. This is usually the cluster login node address.

**9.** The **Head queue name** which is the name of the queue, on the cluster, used to launch the execution of the Nextflow runtime.

**10.** The **Compute queue name** which is the name of the queue, on the cluster, to which pipeline jobs are submitted.

!!! tip
    The Compute queue can be overridden as a configuration option in the Nextflow pipeline configuration. See Nextflow [docs](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#queue) for more details.

**11.** You can specify certain environment variables on the Head job or the Compute job using the **Environment variables** option.

**Advanced options**

**12.** Optionally, you can customize **Nextflow queue size** field to control the number of Nextflow jobs submitted to the queue at the same time.


**13.** Optionally, you can use the **Head job submit options** to  specify options to the head job.


**14.** Select **Create** to finalize the creation of the compute environment.
