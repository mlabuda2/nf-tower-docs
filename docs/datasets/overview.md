1. Open any pipeline from the [Launchpad](/launch/launchpad) containing a [pipeline-schema](/pipeline-schema/overview).

2. Click on the input field for the pipeline, removing any default value. 

3. Pick the right dataset for your pipeline

!!! warning
    The Datasets shown in the dropdown menu depends upon the validation specified in your [pipeline-schema](/pipeline-schema/overview). Hence, if the schema specifies only `CSV` format, no `TSV` dataset would appear in the dropdown.
