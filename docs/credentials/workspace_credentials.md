## Introduction

In Tower, you can configure **Workspace credentials** to store the access keys for your [Compute Environments](../compute-envs/overview.md). 

### General instructions

1. From the **Credentials tab**, select **Add Credentials**. 
2. Enter a unique name in the **Name** field using alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores. 
3. From the **Provider** drop-down list, select the provider the credentials will be used for. The **New Credentials** form displays additional fields to be completed based on your choice. 
4. Add the credential details needed for authentication to the relevant compute environment you are creating the credentials for. 
5. Select **Add**. 

For details specific to each provider, see the relevant Compute Environment page.
